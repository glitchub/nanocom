Nanocom supports running arbitrary shell commands with stdout attached to the
target device input, stdin attached to the target device output, and stderr
attached to the terminal.

Characters output by the shell command to stderr will appear on the terminal.
Each line is prefaced with a '|' character to indicate that it is shell command
output.

Keys typed to the terminal will be sent to the shell command's stderr. The
exception is the ^] key which brings up the nanocom menu in the usual way. Note
^C and so forth are sent to the shell command, which may or may not ignore
them. However menu command 'x' will always kill a running shell command.

This allows programs such as 'sz' to work in a natural way, it also allows
creation of scripts tt can interact with the user and the target device to
perform various operations.

Included in this directory ar example shell and expect scripts.
