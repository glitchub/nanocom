If SHELLCMD is enabled in the Makefile then nanocom supports running arbitrary shell commands via the ^\x menu option
or tyhe -x command line parameter.

The command's stdin and stdout are attached to the remote device via bi-directional pipe, and stderr is attached to
the console via a pty.

Characters sent by the command to stderr will appear on the console, with a leading '|' per line to indicate that it
is shell command output.

Characters typed on the console can be read via stderr, this includes ^C and so forth. However ^\ still brings up the
nanocom menu, from there 'x' can be used to kill the running command.

Programs such as 'sz' can therefore be used to provide file transfer from or to from the target.

However this also allows creation of scripts that can interact with the user and the target to perform arbitrary
operations, example scripts are provided here.
