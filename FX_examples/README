"FX" stands for "file transfer", and traditional FX commands are programs such as "sz", "rx", and
"kermit" that provide in-band file transfer over a serial connection.

In a broader sense, an FX command is any program that expects to communicate with a remote host via
stdin and stdout, and interact with the user via stderr.

If FXCMD is enabled in the Makefile then nanocom provides the ^\x menu option and the -x command
line parameter to run FX commands.

Command strings are passed to sh for execution, with environment variable NANOCOM set to the target
name that was specified on the command line.

Keyboard input is sent to stderr except ^\ which brings up the nanocom menu, and specifically ^\x
will cause the FX command to be terminated.

Example bash and expect scripts are provided here.

Note prefixing an FX command string with "-" inhibits command start and result reports.
