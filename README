A simple serial/tcp comm program intended for use with (and on) embedded
systems.  Supports telnet and high-character locale mapping.

Usage:

    nanocom [options] /dev/ttyX|host:port

Connect current tty to specified target, which is either a serial device (if
target contains a '/') or a TCP host (if target contains a ':').

Options:

    -b          - backspace key sends DEL instead of BS
    -d          - toggle serial port DTR high on start
    -e          - enter key sends LF instead of CR
    -f file     - log console output to specified file
    -h          - display unprintable characters as hex, 2X to display all characters as hex
    -i encoding - encoding for high characters e.g. 'CP437', or '' to display verbatim
    -n          - don't set serial port to 115200 N-8-1, use it as is
    -r          - try to reconnect target if it won't open or closes with error
    -s          - display timestamp, 2X to display with date
    -t          - enable telnet in binary mode, 2X for ASCII mode (handles CR+NUL)
