A simple serial/tcp comm program intended for use with (and on) embedded
systems.  Supports telnet and high-character locale mapping.

Usage:

    nanocom [options] /dev/ttyX|host:port

Connect current tty to specified target, which is either a serial device (if
target contains a '/') or a TCP host (if target contains a ':').

Options:

    -b          - backspace key sends DEL instead of BS
    -d          - toggle serial port DTR high on start
    -e          - enter key sends LF instead of CR, 2X to send CR+LF, 3X to send CR+NUL
    -f file     - tee received data to specified file
    -i encoding - encoding for high characters, empty string to pass verbatim ('iconv -l' for list)
    -n          - don't set serial port to 115200 N-8-1, use it as is
    -r          - try to reconnect target if it won't open or closes with error
    -s          - enable timestamps, 2X to also show date
    -t          - enable telnet IAC handling, 2X to disable BINARY and default enter to CR+NUL
    -x          - show unprintable chars as hex, 2X to show all chars as hex
