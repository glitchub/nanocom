A simple serial/tcp comm program intended for use with embedded systems.

Usage:

    nanocom [options] /dev/ttyX|host:port

Connect current tty to specified target, which is either a serial device (if
target contains a '/') or a TCP host (if target contains a ':').

Options:

    -b       - backspace keys sends DEL instead of BS
    -c       - encode CP437 characters from target (IBM line draw)
    -d       - toggle serial port DTR high on start
    -e       - enter key sends LF instead of CR (use twice to send CRLF)
    -f file  - tee received data to specified file
    -n       - use existing tty config, don't force 115200 N-8-1
    -r       - try to reconnect to target if it won't open or closes with error
    -s       - enable timestamps (use twice to enable dates)
    -t       - enable telnet IAC handling (use twice to disable server ECHO)
    -x       - show unprintable chars as hex (use twice to show all chars as hex)
