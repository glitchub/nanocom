    -b          - backspace key sends DEL instead of BS
    -d          - toggle serial port DTR high on start
    -e          - enter key sends LF instead of CR
    -f file     - log console output to specified file
    -h          - display unprintable characters as hex
    -H          - display all characters as hex
    -i          - display high-bit characters as CP437
    -I charset  - character set for -i, instead of CP437 ('iconv -l' for list)
    -l mS       - flush characters after first connect until idle for specified mS
    -L mS       - also flush on reconnect
    -n          - don't force target tty to 115200 N-8-1
    -r          - try to reconnect target if it won't open or closes with error
