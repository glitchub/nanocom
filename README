Usage:

    nanocom [options] /dev/ttyX|host:port

Connect current tty to specified target, which is either a serial device (if
target contains a '/') or a TCP host (if target contains a ':').

Options:

    -a          - rate-limit transmit to one character per millisecond
    -b          - backspace key sends DEL instead of BS
    -d          - toggle serial port DTR high on start
    -e          - enter key sends LF instead of CR
    -f file     - log console output to specified file
    -h          - display unprintable characters as hex
    -H          - display all characters as hex
    -i          - display high-bit characters as CP437
    -I charset  - character set for -i, default CP437 ('iconv -l' for list)
    -k          - with -f, also log key presses
    -l mS       - flush characters after connect until idle for specified milliseconds
    -n          - don't set serial port to 115200 N-8-1, use it as is
    -r          - try to reconnect target if it won't open or closes with error
    -s          - display timestamps
    -S          - display long timestamps (with date)
    -t          - enable telnet in binary mode
